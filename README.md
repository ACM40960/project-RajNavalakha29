## Image Aesthetics impact on Social Media Engagement
The repository explores various methodologies and technologies that contribute to the development of an automated aesthetic quality assessment system, particularly for food content.
### Description
One of the most important factors affecting user engagement on social networking sites like Instagram is the aesthetic quality of photographs. Understanding and enhancing the visual appeal of their posts can greatly improve the online appearance and engagement of users who want to create a business account centered around food-related content. The combination of **Deep Learning, Neural Networks, and Monte Carlo simulations** enables the development of an automated system for evaluating aesthetic quality. This system provides dependable insights for improving engagement and optimizing content.
### Models used for prediction
1. XGBoost - Extreme Gradient Boosting
2. SVR - Support Vector Regression
3. Gradient Boost
4. MLP - Multi-Layer Perceptron
With the help of the above machine learning and deep learning models we were able to rectify the accuracy of all the  models to predict the engagement dynamics of the each image of the dataset. Along with the relevant python libraries **Torch, Seaborn and Tensorflow** have also been used to implement the mentioned models.
